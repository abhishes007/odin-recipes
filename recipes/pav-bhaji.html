        <h2>What is Pav Bhaji?</h2>
        <p>Pav Bhaji is a popular Indian curry dish that originated in the state of Maharashtra. It consists of a flavorful and spicy vegetable curry, known as bhaji, served with soft bread rolls called pav. The bhaji is made by cooking a medley of vegetables like potatoes, tomatoes, peas, onions, and capsicum, along with a blend of aromatic spices. The vegetables are mashed together to create a thick and luscious curry. Pav Bhaji is typically garnished with fresh coriander, a squeeze of lemon juice, and a dollop of butter. It is enjoyed as a street food snack or as a main course dish. The combination of the rich and tangy curry with the soft and buttery pav rolls makes Pav Bhaji a delightful and satisfying meal.</p>
