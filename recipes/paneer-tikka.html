Each bite bursts with the zesty tang of yogurt, the warmth of aromatic spices, and the freshness of bell peppers and onions. Veg Paneer Tikka is a vegetarian favorite that delivers a burst of Indian flavors in every savory bite, making it a perfect starter for any meal or a great addition to your next barbecue or gathering.</p>
